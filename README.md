Sparql-Mapviewer by Bureau Digitaal Erfgoed
=====================
Simple web mapping application for visualising well-known text encoded geometries from sparql endpoints. Although it has default queries as standard, it accepts a different sparql endpoint, and a different query as input parameter in the URL. It was created in the 2014 for the purposes of the "Putten uit de Haarlemse Geschiedenis" [PUHG](http://bureaudigitaalerfgoed.nl/puhg) project,for the visualization of cess pits and water wells of archaeological Haarlem. The application is based on (forked from) the Erfgoed & Locatie Archeo-Peilbuizen proof of concept, in the 2013-2014 season of the Platform Implementation Linked Open Data [PiLOD](http://www.pilod.nl)
